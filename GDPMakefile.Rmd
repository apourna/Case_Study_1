This is a case study to analyse the Gross Domestic product data of countries around the world. The data
is pulled from worldbank.org. The information is scattered in 2 data files, one is the GDP ranking table and another is the FEDSTATS per country data file. The two files are analysed and a subset of the information required for the case study is pulled out and consolidated here. The project is using R for 
tidying data & analysis. As a first step, installing and loading libraries required for the analysis.

##Basic Setup for R

All the packages needs to be downloaded from the R CRAN repository

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
chooseCRANmirror(graphics=FALSE, ind=1)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

##Set the Working Directory

Working directory is set to the main project directory. Please edit it as required when the project is 
re-used.

```{r set working directory, include=TRUE}
setwd("/Users/ASHMOHAN 1/Desktop/Data_Science/SMU_Term1_Doing_Data_science/Project_2_caseStudy/Case_Study_1")
```

##Install and load the required library for the project

Packages are downloaded to help tidy the data and analysis.
```{r download packages, include=TRUE}
source("packages_for_case_study.R")
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
